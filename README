Base Kohana3 pagination module, just changed the views. 

In the original one, if we were on the first page, pagination was showing first and previous as normal text.
In this version we have the span around it, so You can hide them.

Moreover, the pagination is prepared for older browser, which doesn't understand the a[rel=prev] css selectors. 
So, for them there is a suitable class added.
